# Panau-Survival-Server
All server code for the JC2MP server Panau Survival

## Getting Set Up
1. Clone the repo into your JC2MP server directory.
2. Set `IKnowWhatImDoing` to true in the server's config.
3. Delete `server.db` in case you've run the server before to ensure a clean start.
4. Edit line 5 of `scripts/inventory/server/sLootManager.lua` and replace `"lootspawns/lootspawns.txt"` with `"lootspawns_old.txt"`. This will allow the loot to spawn using the old loot spawns data file.
5. Copy `scripts/modelchanger/shModelLocations_old.lua` to `scripts/modelchanger/shared/shModelLocations.lua`
5. Copy `scripts/modelchanger/shModelLocationsObject.lua` to `scripts/modelchanger/shared/shModelLocationsObject.lua`
5. Run `git submodule update --init scripts/voice` to install the voice chat submodule, then navigate inside and follow setup in `website` to complete setup for voice chat.
5. You're all set!
